#### A SPA Router Demo WIth React+Svelte+Vue apps
> This app shows how a SPA router works with different SPAs deployed on different path

With this demo I tried to teach how a SPA router works and how client side routing can be done.
If you are very passionate about this server and network related queries you may star this repo 'cause in the next project I will demonstrate how SPA router can help host two or more SPA apps at the same project with same boilerplate.

You can also reach me out through my github profile for more information as I like to help people learn about these things ;)


#### Addtions
*Here I have just ensured that the router can host different apps on different paths without any conflicts in the resolution of the path*
The `server.js` is a express app that, with the help of middlewares, can make a easy router which somehow connects different apps and can make them accessible through the same url on different paths.

#### Contributes
Definately accepted in the form of an issue.
